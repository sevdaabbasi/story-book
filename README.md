My Storybook App,
which I developed using Swift and Xcode, 
provides a structure where users can list stories and view their details.
I used the Foundation and UIKit libraries to create this application,
which includes basic data types and classes,
as well as visual interface elements and application structures.

The application allows users to select from a list of tales and view the details of the selected tale.
Images and text are stored as UIImage and String and shown in the detail view.
Listing and detail display is realized with UITableView and UIViewController classes.
